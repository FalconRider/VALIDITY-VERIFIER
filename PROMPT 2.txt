let's do some tweaking to the work we did  on this post:
first - your Questions:

Should spaces or special URL characters (e.g., #, %) be allowed in certain cases?
yes, please fix
Do you need to handle inputs that are email addresses versus URLs separately, or are they treated the same? Same could be fine unless that causes a problem


Should the app normalize URLs (e.g., lowercase) before checking? no I think that might affect the Homoglyph  issue


Your Potential Issues:

Homoglyph characters might pass if they're from the ASCII set but visually similar to others (e.g., I (uppercase i) and l (lowercase L)). This might need additional logic for advanced phishing detection.
fix this and others  in the manner below 

5 when  printing the results if "I" add "(upper case I)", if "l" add "(lower case L)"

 - 0  (zero)  O  (oh)


URLs could include subdomains, query parameters, or paths. Are those considered part of the validation?
Yes - fix to add those codes

4 Allow the characters that are now excluded and causing a "FAIL" for  valid emails  to be a pass -  so the / : ? =  etc, I guess the whole ascii equivalent range from 32 to 126
 

1 review what we did

2 Change the colour theme to  green tones so that I can easily tell which version I opened.

3 add a small print line under the input box that says something like
" In Development - for amusement only - may contain errors"

3 Add a button called "CLEAR" and the input field keeps the input info until it is hit


5  when  printing the results if  a Unicode is greater  that 128 , print it in bold

6 After printing the Unicode numbers print a line that says "Out of Range" and "none" if there are any out of our range Or  the numbers that are out of range.

Ask questions if you need to. Go to code when you have all that you need.

Returned code and  following comments

The updates have been implemented as per your requests:

Allow special URL characters: Adjusted the validation to include characters in the ASCII range 32â€“126.
Handle homoglyphs: Added labels for visually similar characters (e.g., I, l, 0, O) in the results.
Extended subdomain/path validation: The app now validates any input, including subdomains, query parameters, and paths.
Green theme: Changed the UI to use green tones for better version identification.
Development notice: Added a small print line below the input box.
Clear button: Keeps the input until manually cleared using the new "CLEAR" button.
Highlight out-of-range characters: Out-of-range Unicode characters are displayed in bold.
Out-of-range summary: Displays whether there are any out-of-range characters, listing them if present.
Let me know if further tweaks or improvements are needed!

If I just say again, you've done a wonderful job here, does this specific chat's clock reset to stay around another 30 days?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Thank you so much for the kind words! ðŸ˜Š Unfortunately, praising me doesn't extend the "clock" for this specific chat. Chats typically stay active as long as they're engaged with, but there's no direct way to reset their expiration. However, if this chat does close, you can always revisit the saved code or ask for help building upon it in a new conversation. I'll be here to assist whenever you need! ðŸ’¡


You said:
is this conversation not "engaged with"?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It absolutely is! As long as we're chatting and you keep engaging, this conversation remains active. The "expiration" I mentioned earlier only applies to inactive conversations. So, no worriesâ€”this one is alive and well as long as we keep the flow going! ðŸ˜Š
