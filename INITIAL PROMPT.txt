INITIAL PROMPT


Can you give me the code for an html page, with a little CSS to make it pretty,
and what ever JavaScript, python or flask  you need to make it work.

It would function as 
A verifier that a URL   is not a fraudulent version of an existing businesses address.


Based on the concept that true URLs are made up of the decimal equivalents of  "ASCII " characters a to z upper and lowercase. plus the "." dot (45)and the "@"(64).  In other words "ASCHII"  range chr 46 to 122, excluding 58 to 63. Include 64 "@" so that emails could also be checked

and fraudulent URLs contain Unicode characters from other  languages, like Cyrillic, that appear similar 
but are outside this range.

And as I understand it Ascii was incorporated into the Unicode character sets used to day at the beginning, so this should work

The page would have  a large bold title "FAKE EMAIL and URL CHECKER".

then the statement "Check your URL. Cut and paste it Here"
then an input box, for the user to  cut and paste a suspect apps URL

Then a button that says "TEST URL"

The app would return the decimal equivalent numbers in Unicode of each character, in a comma separated line to save space

and the evaluate if each were in the equivalent Ascii good range.

and state either "PASS"   or FAIL



Hitting the button again would clear the old URL.

So after loading the program 


If I cut and pasted Doge.com

I would get

68,111,103,101,46,99,111,109,

PASS



if I entered:

DÐžge.com 

It would catch that Cyrillic "o"  and 



return 

68,486,103,101,46,99,486,109,

and return ""FAIL

my examples may not be perfect but are meant to demons68,111,103,101,46,99,111,109,
demonstrate the concept.

First comment on the validity of my idea.

Then  ask me questions if you need to, go to code, in a single  html file with imbedded CSS and JS , when you have what you need.
